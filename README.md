# spwnr
This package was created to make the raw data and functions available from 'Comparison of known spawner abundance from fence counts to visual counts for simplified spawner estimation methods.' Askey et al. (2023)in review) in the Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences.      Includes data comparing visual counts of Kokanee spawners to census data from spawner fences. 

# Installation
Install with devtools package from PAskey github account

```R
#First install the devtools package from CRAN with:
install.packages("devtools")

#Next install the SPDT package from PAskey Github repo as:
devtools::install_github("PAskey/spwnr").
```

# Usage
The primary objective of this package is to make data available to others, and document code for key functions in the paper: 'Comparison of known spawner abundance from fence counts to visual counts for simplified spawner estimation methods.'

# Main functions and uses

  * More detailed explanations of any of the functions below can be founds by typing ?function into the R console. E.g. ?GAUC. If you want to see the raw source code for any of the functions type View(function name) e.g. View(GAUC). If you would like to make changes of that code, ideally you go to my Github account to get the source code and create a branch with your potential edits.

There are currently 3 data sets avaiable that were used in the published data analyses:
